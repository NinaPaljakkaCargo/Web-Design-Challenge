        <p>
           This plot shows wind speed relative to latitude. From this
           plot it can be observed that wind speed majority lies between 0 and 
           10 mph. It can also be seen that there are higher wind speeds in general
           on the lower and higher ends of latitute, further from the equator.
           The plot suggests that there may be some correlation between wind speed
           and latitude.
