        <p>This plot shows maximum city temperature relative to latitude. From this
           plot it can be observed that it resembles a standard curve, having an upside-down "U"
           shape. This suggests that there is a relationship between lower maxiumum temperature and 
           latitudes which are very high or very low, and the highest maxiumum temperatures are found closest to latitude of 0
           degrees, or the equator.
